👋 **Hi**

My name is Marcin and I am Unity Developer. Already in elementary school I started my journey with computers by creating 2D graphics in **GIMP** and recording videos in **Sony Vegas**. Later I spend many time in **Blender** 🖥️

I wanted to use my **3D** car model to create a racing game in my family city. I had no experience with programming so I gave up but it was first step to learn **programming**. After failure I started learning programming basics in **C++** 👨‍💻 

Now I mainly develop games in **Unity** and learns others **programming** languages. I am CEO of **Overlapp** 😎

💼 **Ready To Go**

I currently search for cool **internship** that i have to do because of **school** 🏫
